## 6.1. Disk space
quota : All students are allocated a certain amount of disk space on the file system for their personal files, usually about 100Mb. 
If you go over your quota, you are given 7 days to remove excess files.
df : The df command reports on the space left on the file system.
du : The du command outputs the number of kilobyes used by each subdirectory.

## 6.2 Save space
gzip: This reduces the size of a file, thus freeing valuable disk space.
To expand the file, use the gunzip command.

## 6.3. Read files
zcat: zcat will read gzipped files without needing to uncompress them first.
diff : This command compares the contents of two files and displays the differences.

## 6.4. Search files
find : This searches through the directories for files and directories with a given name, date, size, or any other attribute you care to specify.

## 6.5 History
history: The C shell keeps an ordered list of all the commands that you have entered
(Very useful when you forget the last command and helps save time)
